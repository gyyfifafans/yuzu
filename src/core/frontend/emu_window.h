/**
 * Abstraction class used to provide an interface between emulation code and the frontend
 * (e.g. SDL, QGLWidget, GLFW, etc...).
 *
 * Design notes on the interaction between EmuWindow and the emulation core:
 * - Generally, decisions on anything visible to the user should be left up to the GUI.
 *   For example, the emulation core should not try to dictate some window title or size.
 *   This stuff is not the core's business and only causes problems with regards to thread-safety
 *   anyway.
 * - Under certain circumstances, it may be desirable for the core to politely request the GUI
 *   to set e.g. a minimum window size. However, the GUI should always be free to ignore any
 *   such hints.
 * - EmuWindow may expose some of its state as read-only to the emulation core, however care
 *   should be taken to make sure the provided information is self-consistent. This requires
 *   some sort of synchronization (most of this is still a TODO).
 * - DO NOT TREAT THIS CLASS AS A GUI TOOLKIT ABSTRACTION LAYER. That's not what it is. Please
 *   re-read the upper points again and think about it if you don't see this.
